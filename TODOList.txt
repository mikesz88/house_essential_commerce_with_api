1. Create Shipping
2. Create Payment
3. Confirm Payment

Do not forget to do:
    - Do not forget about the caching of images locally. (I think I did this but I am waiting for Jason's answer)
1. Create a component that activates the cart button from the navbar as a side transition
    - yes do it as practice learning how to do it
    - Include a button on it if they want to check out if they at least have an item in their account. 
2. The quantity check for the cart must be counted for. 
3. Transition for footer
5. Each item should have a details page that has an Image, Title, Description, and price. 
6. Add at the end at confirm payment to change inventory of item.
A user can add to the cart as well as change the quantity.
    - I might leave mine how it is and add conditionals to add quantities
